You are a software engineering instructor, teaching a class of complete beginners. The class just finished an introduction to Git and GitHub. Give the class a few examples of errors the students might run into, and how to resolve them.

Certainly! Here are a few common Git and GitHub errors that beginners might encounter, along with explanations and solutions for each:

### 1. Error: `fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git`
#### Cause:
This error occurs when you try to run Git commands in a directory that is not a Git repository.

#### Solution:
Ensure you are in the correct directory where your Git repository is initialized. You can initialize a new repository by running:
```bash
git init
```
Or navigate to an existing repository:
```bash
cd path/to/your/repo
```

### 2. Error: `error: src refspec master does not match any`
#### Cause:
This error typically occurs when you try to push a branch that doesn't exist. For example, if you try to push the `master` branch, but your branch is named `main`.

#### Solution:
First, check your branch name:
```bash
git branch
```
If your branch is `main`, use:
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 3. Error: `fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled`
#### Cause:
This happens when Git cannot find the credentials to authenticate your GitHub account, often due to using HTTPS URLs and not having a credentials helper set up.

#### Solution:
Set up a credential helper or switch to SSH:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper cache
```
Or switch to SSH by following GitHub's guide on [SSH key setup](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh).

### 4. Error: `merge conflict in <filename>`
#### Cause:
A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically resolve differences in code between two branches.

#### Solution:
1. Open the conflicted file(s) in your text editor.
2. Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
3. Manually resolve the conflicts by editing the file to your desired content.
4. Mark the conflict as resolved:
```bash
git add <filename>
```
5. Complete the merge:
```bash
git commit
```

### 5. Error: `error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/your-repo.git'`
#### Cause:
This error occurs when your local branch is behind the remote branch, and you need to pull changes first.

#### Solution:
1. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository:
```bash
git pull origin your-branch
```
2. Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise.
3. Push your changes again:
```bash
git push origin your-branch
```

### 6. Error: `remote: Permission to <repo> denied to <user>`
#### Cause:
This error indicates that you do not have the necessary permissions to push to the repository.

#### Solution:
1. Ensure you are logged in to GitHub with the correct account that has push access.
2. Verify your access rights with the repository owner.
3. If using SSH, ensure your SSH key is correctly added to your GitHub account.

### 7. Error: `error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge`
#### Cause:
This occurs when you have local changes that are not committed and you try to pull new changes from the remote repository.

#### Solution:
1. Either commit your local changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
2. Or stash your changes:
```bash
git stash
```
Then pull the changes:
```bash
git pull origin your-branch
```
After pulling, apply your stashed changes:
```bash
git stash apply
```

By being aware of these common errors and understanding how to resolve them, you can troubleshoot issues more effectively and continue working with Git and GitHub smoothly.
